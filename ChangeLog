  languages
- More work on SMIL. Show active SMIL element in playlist using the color

  can be time values but also (mouse) events or clip ends and set/animate can
  be used to alter arguments on-the-fly.

- When controlpanel is in autohide mode, move it over the video instead of
  shifting the video up causing annoying flickering (bug 96861)

- Internals: merge code from backends, with the 'never reaching' goal to add
  a new backend just by configuration (plus a backend player of course)

- Two more regression fixes in show cache progress, get rid of spurious seek
  command caused by switching progress slider usage and don't update playing
  position if there is no position change (might fill cache instead).
- Xinerama fix, fullscreen on display where video widget is on.
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc4
- Fix regression in show cache progress in 0.8.3-rc2, which made the xine
  backend hang on some web movies
- Ripped out the arts volume slider. Now you only get a volume slider if you
  run kmix standalone or as an applet in kicker.
- Try to limit symbols in the shared objects by using KDE_NO_EXPORT. Although
  hard to measure, hopefully speed up loading the plugin
- New recorder (mplayer -dumpstream) from Stefan Siegel
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc3a
- Downloading of .m3u/.pls also eats .asx, so try to read this one too. This
  fixes also MPlayer-1.0pre not been able to read .asx files.
- Make sure if we're downloading a playlist file, it isn't bigger than 50k
- More or less revert the alsa5/alsa9 change to just alsa. Seems latest
  MPlayer doesn't work with alsa5/alsa9. Although they are still available.
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc3
- add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE in configure.in.in, no recheck/automake/autoconf
  version mismatch

- Store xine settings in ~/.kde/share/apps/kmplayer/xine_config and not in
  ~/.xine/config2. Save the first time if file does not exist (Automatically
  sets the misc.memcpy_method).
- Added a debian build directory, builds a kmplayer-lib, kmplayer-plugin and a
  kmplayer-app package. Eg. install only kmplayer-lib and kmplayer-plugin if 
  you prefer another player but do want the plugin for konqueror.
- Added protocol files for mms://, rtsp:// and pnm://
- Position slider now also shows progress of the cache fill
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc1

  fullscreen and embedded part and show them otherwise

  occur more with the latest Qt versions. KMPlayer uses a XSimpleWindow now
  that is managed by QXEmbed

  multible plugins cooperate with imagewindow/controlpanel
- Combine control buttons and position slider to one control panel

- MPlayer-1.0-pre is default now ([MPlayer] Post MPlayer 0.90=true in
  kmplayerrc)

  in one stroke with playback (faster playing, less sensible to failures)
- Xine configuration tab for convenient editing of ~/.xine/config2
- Made config dialog somewhat flexible, and TV/broadcast settings are now
  not available when launched from the plugin

- Build changes, kdeinit wasn't used (speeds up loading) and an option for
  disabling arts volume slider (eg. if you use kmix already)
  use --disable-arts-volume with configure and it prevents linking agains the 
  arts libs (speeds up loading of kmplayer too)
- Moved color sliders to a sub menu, fix it for mplayer

Changes since version 0.7.4c
- Added a simple Xine player backend (kxineplayer). Basically a finger practice
  for the upcoming MPlayer-G2 lib, but now quite useful for rtsp/real playback.

  really doing something). You must set KMPlayer as default viewer for
  audio/x-pn-realaudio to use it.
